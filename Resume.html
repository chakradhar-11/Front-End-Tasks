        Profile:
        
    </h2>
     I am Inukurthi Chakradhar, a graduate from Panimalar Engineering College in the Department of Electronics and
    Communication Engineering (ECE). I am a quick learner,and good listener with strong technical skills
    in IoT, Verilog, System Verilog, Application Packaging, Microsoft Intune, and PowerShell scripting. I gained hands-on
    experience as a Backend Development Intern at Qspiders, where I worked on Java backend development, implemented
    JDBC-based database connectivity and CRUD operations in MySQL, designed optimized SQL queries, and integrated
    backend modules with databases. I am seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge and problem-solving abilities to
    deliver impactful solutions in a dynamic organization
